# 1. Introduction

WebAssembly (WASM) is the ability for your browser to run *compiled* code at (near-) native speeds. It is now recognised by the W3C as the [4th official web programming language](https://www.w3.org/2019/12/pressrelease-wasm-rec.html.en), after HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Basically, this means you can run compiled code written in a variety of programming languages (`C/C++`, `Rust`, `Go`, `AssemblyScript`, [..](https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langs "and many many more")) in your browser, without any need for plugins. In its purest form, you will need some JavaScript to get it running and to communicate with the browser. For instance if you want to have a graphical output such as a game, you will need to link your program to work with available renderers, such as WebGL.

This section will be the tale of my discovery of WebAssembly, and the journey to migrating the 2.9 Micrio version written in plain JavaScript to WebAssembly as much as possible.


# 2. The Current Situation

Micrio 2.9, blabla


# 3. The Discovery

Already back in 2013, a [demo was released](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV32Cs_CMqo) by the Mozilla team running Unreal Engine 3 in the Firefox browser at 60fps, using a port of the engine made ready for the web in only 4 days of work.

This was the first application I saw of [asm.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asm.js) -- allowing compiled code to run inside your browser at near-native speeds, using a super-optimized CPU-friendly subset of JavaScript. You could get this to work by compiling to [LLVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM)-compatible formats using for instance [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) for `C/C++`-code. 

This was a definite game changer for the web and left me wanting to try it out myself for the longest time (*spoiler: it took 6 years*). It was also picked up brilliantly by the major browser engines, each in their own optimizing way.

Fast forward to March 2017. [WebAssembly is introduced](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/03/why-webassembly-is-faster-than-asm-js/) as an even more powerful way to run binary code in your browser. This joint effort by all major browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer) was focussed on bundling all separate efforts made so far by running compiled code inside the browser. I was blown away to realise that *all these browsers have worked together on this*, putting aside their differences.

Two years later in 2019, WebAssembly was recognised by the W3C as [the fourth official programming language for the web](https://www.w3.org/2019/12/pressrelease-wasm-rec.html.en). As soon as I realised there would be a WebAssembly Summit at Google HQ early 2020, I really, *really* wanted to go there to see what's up. I found a colleague at Q42 to join me and in February 2020 we found ourselves in Mountain View, surrounded by an awe-inspiring crowd.

That day was a real eye-opener on what WebAssembly can do, was already doing, and the amount of potential it still has to change how the web works. Not only for running compiled code in your browser, but **so much more** (briefly touched upon at the end of this post). You can watch the entire summit [here on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBZFJzGnBoU&list=PL6ed-L7Ni0yQ1pCKkw1g3QeN2BQxXvCPK).



# 4. The Rewrite: C++ and emscripten

Prior to the WebAssembly Summit, and to get to know the ecosystem, I finally followed up on my mental note from 2013 to play around with [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/). Basically you can take almost any project made in `C` or `C++`, and compile it to a binary `.wasm`-file, that your browser can natively run. 

At this point, I still didn't really have a clear image of where WebAssembly starts and stops, and how autonomously could run inside your browser, so I started a new project from scratch to see if I could make a `C++`-implementation of the basic Micrio logic: a virtual *zoomable* and *pannable* image consisting of a lot of separate tiles, using a virtual camera for displaying only the tiles necessary for what the user is viewing inside your screen.

It turns out, emscripten already had great compatibility for [libsdl](https://www.libsdl.org/): a low-level audio, keyboard/mouse input, and OpenGL library. Which is awesome, because I could write my code using this very well documented library, even including mouse and key inputs and WebGL rendering. Since I was also working with downloading images, I also used the [stb_image.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb) image library.

![Setting up SDL and OpenGL](img/cpp.png "C++ in the 21st century")


The largest struggle of this was picking up `C++` again, never having used it outside of hobby scope many years ago. But after a few days of cursing and second guessing myself, I had a working first version with all of the most important features written with help of the SDL library:

* A virtual camera and all necessary viewing logic;
* Image tiles downloading;
* Rendering using WebGL(/OpenGL) using a simple shader;
* Mouse event handling for panning and zooming the image;
* Resize event handling to fit Micrio to the desired `<canvas>` HTML element

You can see this version running here: https://b.micr.io/_test/wasm/index.html


## 4.1. First Results

As incredibly awesome it was to see Micrio in `C++` running smoothly in my browser, and even handing all the user's input, there were a few reservations, which left me with an unsatisfied feeling.


### 1. Coding C++ felt old-fashioned
Writing C++ felt like going back in time. Incredibly powerful and fully proven, but also archaic, especially as a web developer. I spent more time fiddling with making an optimized `Makefile` than I care to admit.

![The emscripten C++ Makefile](img/makefile.png "( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)")

### 2. The compiled `.wasm` binary was very large
As great as the help of `libsdl` and `stb_image.h` were to let me use OpenGL and JPG image functions, as much did they add to the final compiled binary file. Even with all `emcc` compiler optimizations (which can even use the awesome `closure` JS compiler), the resulting WebAssembly binary file was 760KB; compared to the JavaScript version of Micrio being around 240KB, this was a major setback. These libraries packed a lot of functionalities that were not necessary for Micrio, but were still included in the compiled version.

### 3. TIL: A *glue* file
This is the part where I learnt where the limits of WebAssembly start and finish. **WebAssembly is not a magical self-contained binary that lets you run full applications out of the box**. It actually needs to be *bound* to the browser using JavaScript.

Where I thought that all the SDL OpenGL code in C++ would automagically be recognised by the browser: *wrong*. What `emscripten` does, is to take all OpenGL operations from C++, and _converting them_ to WebGL operations your browser can understand.

Same with the `libsdl` mouse and keyboard-inputs: these were **glued** to the browser using an extra JavaScript file that would set event listeners for the specific cases, and send them to the WebAssembly binary. This separate JavaScript file was generated by the emscripten compiler, and had to be included in the HTML alongside the compiled binary `.wasm`-file.

Everything added together, the new total of the *base engine* of Micrio was a whopping **791KB**; a bit too much for my likes.

However, it's extremely neat that there is a C++ port of Micrio that would run natively on Linux and MacOS-systems. And I learned a lot from this.



# 5. The Rewrite: AssemblyScript

Fast forward a few months, to just after the WebAssembly Summit in Mountain View in February 2020. With a bundle of fresh energy and inspiration, I decided to see if I could use WebAssembly to improve the Micrio JavaScript client a second time.

During the WebAssembly conference, I was very impressed by a [synth demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8j_ieOm4vE) written in **[AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/)**, a language created specifically for WebAssembly, using the TypeScript syntax. Basically you can write (near) TypeScript, which compiles to a `.wasm`-binary. And the great thing-- it's all installed using `npm`, so getting it up and running and compiling your program is super easy! Goodbye `Makefile`!

This time, I wanted to see if it was possible to only let a small part of Micrio run inside WebAssembly, and still use most of the JavaScript that was already inside the client. *How small can we get it?* I decided to focus on a subset of camera functions, such as translating screen coordinates to image coordinates and vice versa. So this time no rendering, event handling, or writing shaders.

![Simple camera functions in AssemblyScript](img/assemblyscript.png "My First AssemblyScript")

The result: a `3KB` file containing some basic math functions, that take an input and return an output. AssemblyScript offers you some *glue-tooling* by providing its own [Loader](https://www.assemblyscript.org/loader.html), which will deal with importing the binary file and being able to call them.

However, this is optional and I ended up using the JavaScript [WebAssembly API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Using_the_JavaScript_API). And it turns out, this is super easy: simply use the `fetch` API to load your compiled `.wasm`-file, cast it as an `ArrayBuffer`, and use the `WebAssembly.instantiate()` function to get it up and running.

![Loading a wasm file](img/instantiate.png "This is awesome")

The compiled binary will then offer an `exports` object, containing the functions that you have written in the AssemblyScript file, which you can immediately call from JavaScript as if they were normal functions. Which made me immediately realise something else:

**WebAssembly is running synchronously to JavaScript!**

Having worked with WebWorkers before, I honestly thought that WebAssembly would run inside its own CPU thread, and that any function calls would require be `async`. Nope, the WASM-functions you call will have their return value available immediately! *This is, like, powerful stuff*!

Since I now had some extra performing hands on deck for Micrio that was very easy to integrate, I decided to include this minimal WebAssembly binary in the then-stable release of Micrio (2.9). Though I didn't want an extra HTTP request for the WASM binary every time someone loaded the Micrio JS; so I included a `base64` encoded version of the WASM-file *inside* the Micrio JS, and for browsers that support it, auto-loaded that. As a fallback, I still had the original JS-only functions in place.

![WASM as base64 embedded in JS](img/b64.png "Somehow this feels like cheating")

This approach worked wonderfully. Zero weird bugs and errors, and (marginal) better performance. The Micrio 2.9-release has been running WASM for a while already!


# 6. The Realization

Okay, so, mission succeeded! The simplest math functions inside the Micrio JS were now handled by WebAssembly. But all rendering logic (Canvas2D for flat images and WebGL for 360&deg; images) was still 100% JavaScript.

This is a small summary of my though process for the weeks that followed:

> *Great.*
>
> *But there **has** to be more I can do with it*
>
> *Can I use it for HTML marker rendering? No -- direct DOM operations are not supported.*
>
> *Can I use it to download the image tiles for me with higher performance? No -- WASM by itself has no download capabilities.*
>
> *Can I replace the current Micrio schizoid Canvas2D and THREEjs rendering methods using one solution?*
>
> *Hmm...*

Yes; yes I could! What if I created my own WebGL renderer, that supports both 2D and 360&deg;?

What is WebGL? To put it oversimplified: a bunch of coordinate-arrays and textures being drawn on your screen using shaders. These arrays are the abstract representation of the zoomable images with individual tiles.

**What if I moved the entire rendering logic to AssemblyScript?**

So kind of like the C++ emscripten implementation, but this time using the lean WebAssembly approach: only replacing parts of my JavaScript, maintaining Micrio's own event handlers and module (markers, tours, audio) logic.



# 7. The Rewrite: AssemblyScript + WebGL

_Third time's a charm._

This iteration, I used what I've learned in my previous two iterations:

1. **It's possible to have the entire rendering logic inside WebAssembly**
2. **It's possible to combine JS en WebAssembly fluently**

Back to the drawing board. What I was going to make was a single WebGL renderer, used for both the 2D and 360&deg; Micrio images, so I could do away with the Canvas2D and THREEjs implementations, not only (hopefully) improving performance, but being able to throw away *a lot* of JS code.

## 7.1. Connecting WebAssembly's memory to WebGL

WebAssembly runs within its own sandbox, using its own requested amount of memory. For instance, a WebAssembly program can request 16MB of memory to work with. This memory is assigned by the browser, and can be fully used by your WebAssembly program.

As the developer, you are **100%** in control of this memory. Micrio is an excellent case where the amount of memory needed to handle the zoomable image logic can be precalculated. So it's entirely possible to have a WebAssembly program that requires *zero* garbage collection; ie. runs without any external optimizations.


![180 bytes of memory for a single 2D tile](img/singletile.png "A single 2D tile takes 180 bytes of memory")


The cool thing is: this memory buffer is fully available from JavaScript as an `ArrayBuffer` object! So if WebAssembly creates an array of vertices in 3D space, and JavaScript can have a *casted view* of those using `Float32Array` (not cloned, simply a pointer to the shared memory space), these can be passed directly to WebGL, since WebGL accepts `Float32Array`s for its geometry and UV/normal buffers!

That means that the output of WebAssembly is **directly connected** to WebGL's input by JavaScript *just once*, at initialization.


![JavaScript directly connecting WebAssembly output to WebGL input](img/connoct.jpg)



## 7.2. Doing the hard work

This is where it became more difficult. I had to *actually* take all the JS code for rendering 2D images using Canvas2D and 360&deg; images using THREEjs/WebGL, and rewrite it in such a way that all that logic is ported to AssemblyScript.

This required a few steps, which I will not fully document here since it's out of scope (*next blogpost: WebGL?*):

### Get the logic of the image `tiles` from JS to AssemblyScript
The input for AssemblyScript are only image parameters: a unique ID, the image width and height. The output must be WebGL-ready vertex and texture UV array buffers, containing all coordinates of all tiles and their individual texture mappings.

WebGL in its raw form gives you only low level functions to work with. Where drawing a tile in Canvas2D was simply using `context.drawImage(...)` with some relative coordinates, now all tiles should be united in a single vertex buffer having static positions, which WebGL will draw relative to a virtual camera's 3D Matrix.

### 2D images
Now, the geometry for a 2D image is not that difficult. It is a flat plane inside the 3D space; all logic can be written as 2D coordinates, where `z` is always 0. A single tile is simply defined as a flat plane, with 6 vertex coordinates (your GPU thinks in *triangles*, so every rectangle consists of `2 * 3` vertex coordinates).

![A rectangle represented as triangles in GL](img/triangle.png)

### 360&deg; images
For the 360 images, this proved to be a larger challenge. Where THREEjs has added a super awesome higher level API where I was using `THREE.SphereBufferGeometry` to create the individual tiles inside the 360 sphere, resulting in all geometry and texture mapping being taken care of, now I had to go back to middle school and refamiliarize myself with all `sin`, `cos` and `tan` math knowledge.

I really, really wish I paid better attention in school then.

Where 2D images are easy since they are, well, 2D, creating a 360&deg; sphere comes with a whole range of new complexities. A tile cannot simple be a rectangle in 3d-space, because it would look very wonky for the tiles on a lower zoom level:

![Low vs high detailed geometry](img/360-geom.png "Left is basic rectangle geometry, right is interpolated")

So a single tile cannot consist of a single rectangle; it has to be broken up into multiple segments to make it look like a smooth sphere inside WebGL. Instead of representing it as 6 vertex coordinates, this number is now `numberOfSegments * numberOfSegments * 2 * 3`, based on the zoom level of the tile to be drawn.

It all makes sense. But it took a long time before I got it right; not even mentioning the separate texture UV buffers here.

![A vertex buffer as Float32Array](img/vertexbuffer.png)

All this results in a single array buffer useable by WebGL, generated at runtime.


### Getting WebGL to only render the tiles that are inside your screen

This is what's so cool about WebGL: you can tell it to render certain *parts* of your pregenerated geometry buffer. All I need is to know the individual tiles' buffer start index, and the number of coordinates the tile uses in 3d space, and those are the only parameters to pass to WebGL to draw this tile (alongside the correct texture reference-- disregarded here).

The functions to decide what those tiles are, are quite different for 2D and 360&deg; images, the latter using a lot of 3D Matrix calculations, which would definitely benefit from the move of JS to AssemblyScript.

All I need to know in AssemblyScript are the dimensions of your browser window, how the virtual camera is positioned, to return an array of `start` and `length` indices to WebGL, to draw the tiles:

![The WebGL tile drawing function](img/drawtile.png "The literal tile drawing function")

**Note**: the actual WebGL rendering function is called from **inside** AssemblyScript. Yes, it is totally possible to call JavaScript-functions from inside WebAssembly!
